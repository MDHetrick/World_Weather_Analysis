# World Weather Analysis - Vacation Planning
## Project Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to create a vacation itinerary based on preferred minimum and maximum temperatures.
### Resources:
- Requests library version 2.27.1
- Python version 3.7.11
- Jupyter Notebook 6.4.6
### Process:
First, a database of weather data was created. From this database, a preferred temperature range was selected, and city results were filtered. From the filtered results, hotel data was obtained. The cities that had hotel data and appropriate temperatures were mapped. From this map, four vacation destinations were selected. Driving routes were mapped between the cities, and informational markers were applied.
### Summary: 
- Preferred temperatures were 60-80 degrees Fahrenheit
- With this temperature requirement, the following map was created for all vacation location options:

- From this map, four cities were selected. Driving routes between the four cities was mapped.
